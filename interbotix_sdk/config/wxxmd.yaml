# SETUP OF REGISTERS FOR THE INTERBOTIX TURRETS
#
# All registers were left to their default values except for the ones listed here:
#   1) ID.........................The id of the Dynamixel servo. These range from 1 to 8 depending on the arm.
#   2) Baud_Rate..................The speed at which serial communication occurs. All arms have this set to 1M
#                                 baud (corresponds to a register value of '3')
#   3) Return_Delay_Time..........The amount of time the servo delays in sending a reply packet after receiving a
#                                 command packet. A value of '0' tells the servo to send a reply without any delay.
#   4) Drive_Mode:................Used to define what direction is positive rotation. A value of '0' means CCW is
#                                 positive while a value of '1' means CW is positive. It also defines if profiles are
#                                 built based on velocity or time. 'Velocity' is the default (value of '0') and 'Time'
#                                 is a value of '4'. Adding the 'direction' value to the 'profile' value gives the
#                                 appropiate register value
#   5) Velocity_Limit.............Defines the max speed of the motor. A value of '131' correpsonds to a max speed
#                                 of PI rad/s
#   6) Min_Position_Limit.........Defines the minimum limit of a joint. Values range from 0 to 4095 with 2048
#                                 being equivalent to '0' rad and 0 being '-PI' rad.
#   7) Max_Position_Limit.........Defines the maximum limit of a joint. Values range from 0 to 4095 with 2048
#                                 being equivalent to '0' rad and 4095 being 'PI' rad.
#   8) Secondary_ID...............If a joint is controlled by two motors (usually by the shoulder or elbow), one motor
#                                 can be set to follow the commands of another motor by setting this register to the ID
#                                 of the master. A value of '255' disables this.
#
# Each motor's configs are grouped under the name of the joint the motor is controlling. The names are defined at
# http://support.interbotix.com/ under the 'Specifications' section. (Click a robot and scroll down to the 'Default Joint Limits' section.)
#
# To make the process of loading and setting the configs more efficient, the 'order' sequence defines the order that the interbotix_sdk node should process the configs.
